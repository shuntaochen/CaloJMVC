An MVC project in java, my custom MVC project for use, check out the **master** branch for the the full project.


I planned on making the project a general mixture of MVC framework that uses all the java basises I have mastered; 
It makes use of the java exchange server and thread pool, and use url parameters as routes to create controller objects;
Also integrated all utilities; I will make this a maven project later on;

Of course, I may switch to use existing frameworks such as springboot etc. in actual practices, but this one is to gain general mastery,,


Todos: 
1. performance tuning, load test
2. fly weight for system created objects to avoid too many instantiation costing too much memory such as, satisfact, handler, some objects should be singleton.
3. business logic caching, etc.
