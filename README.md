An MVC project in java, my custom MVC project for use


I planned on making the project a general mixture of MVC framework that uses all the java basises I have mastered; 
It makes use of the java exchange server and thread pool, and use url parameters as routes to create controller objects;
Also integrated all utilities; I will make this a maven project later on;

Of course, I may switch to use existing frameworks such as springboot etc. in actual practices, but this one is to gain general mastery,,
